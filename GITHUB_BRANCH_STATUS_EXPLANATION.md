## 🎯 **What You're Seeing is CORRECT**

### **✅ GitHub Default Branch: `main`**

### **✅ Why This is Correct:**

1. **GitHub Default Branch Policy**
   - GitHub shows the **default branch** (`main`) as the primary branch
   - This is the branch that appears when someone visits your repository
   - The `main` branch is intentionally kept stable and production-ready

2. **Branch Strategy Explanation**
   - **`main`**: Stable production code (default branch on GitHub)
   - **`dev`**: Active development (most recent commits)
   - **`staging`**: Pre-production testing
   - **`prod`**: Production deployment

### **Recent Development Activity (Last 4 Days):**

| Date | Branch | Commit | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Today** | `dev` | `71af4b0` | GitHub sync status report |
| **Today** | `dev` | `e14d5c0` | Production cleanup summary |

### **What Happened 3 Days Ago (September 29):**
The commit `370bffe` on the `main` branch was a **critical bug fix** that:

## 🔄 **Current Sync Status**

### **✅ All Branches Are Properly Synced:**

```bash
# Local branches and their remote tracking
* dev      → origin/dev     (✅ up to date)
  main     → origin/main    (⚠️ local out of date - INTENTIONAL)
  prod     → origin/prod    (✅ up to date)  
  staging  → origin/staging (✅ up to date)
```

### **✅ Why `main` Shows "Local Out of Date":**
- **Expected Behavior**: The local `main` branch hasn't been updated with recent `dev` changes
- **Intentional Design**: We develop on `dev` and only merge to `main` for stable releases
- **GitHub Correctly Shows**: The last stable commit from 3 days ago

## 🎯 **Branch Development Flow**

### **✅ Current Workflow (Working Correctly):**

1. **Development**: Work happens on `dev` branch
2. **Testing**: Promote to `staging` for testing  
3. **Production**: Deploy from `prod` branch
4. **Stable Release**: Merge to `main` when ready for stable release

### **✅ Recent Activity Flow:**
```
dev (latest) ──→ staging ──→ prod
     ↓
   main (stable, 3 days old) ← Last stable release
```

## 🔧 **What You Should Do**

### **Option 1: Keep Current Setup (Recommended)**
- ✅ **Keep `main` as stable branch** (what GitHub shows)
- ✅ **Continue development on `dev`**
- ✅ **Merge to `main` only for major releases**

### **Option 2: Update Main Branch (If Desired)**
If you want `main` to show the latest changes:

```bash
# Switch to main and merge latest dev changes
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push origin main
```

### **Option 3: Change GitHub Default Branch (If Desired)**
If you want GitHub to show `dev` as default:
1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Change default branch from `main` to `dev`
