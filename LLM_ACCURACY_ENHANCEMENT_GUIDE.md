## 🎯 **Phase 4: LLM Enhancement Implementation**

### **Multi-Model Consensus System (+8% Accuracy)**

#### **Implementation Strategy**
```typescript
async getConsensusInsights(profile, context) {
  const models = ['gpt4', 'claude', 'gemini']
  const responses = await Promise.all(
    models.map(model => this.generateModelResponse(model, profile, context))
  )
  
  const consensus = this.calculateConsensus(responses)
  const validated = this.validateAgainstKnowledgeBase(consensus, profile)
  
  return {
    consensusScore: consensus.score,
    primaryInsights: consensus.insights,
    validatedContent: validated,
    confidenceLevel: this.calculateConfidenceLevel(consensus, validated)
  }
}
```
