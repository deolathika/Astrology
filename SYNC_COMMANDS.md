# üîÑ Commands to Run After Creating Dev Branch on GitHub

## After you create the dev branch on GitHub, run these commands:

### 1. Fetch the new remote branch
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### 2. Set up tracking between local and remote dev branch
```bash
git branch -u origin/dev dev
```

### 3. Verify the connection
```bash
git branch -vv
```
*Should show: `* dev [origin/dev: ahead X] ...`*

### 4. Push your local changes (should work now)
```bash
git push origin dev
```

### 5. Verify success
Check: https://github.com/deolathika/Astrology/branches
*Should now show both "main" and "dev" branches*

## Alternative if push still fails:
If the push still times out due to size, we can:
1. Create a smaller commit with just the essential fixes
2. Push incrementally
3. Use GitHub's web interface to merge

## Current local branch status:
- ‚úÖ Local dev branch exists with latest fixes
- ‚úÖ Repository size optimized (removed build artifacts)
- ‚úÖ All critical issues fixed (Next.js config, logInfo import)
- ‚è≥ Waiting for remote dev branch creation
