# 🔐 Authentication Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: User Signup Redirect

### 🎯 Problem
Users were not being redirected to the home page after creating a new account. The signup flow was redirecting to `/onboarding/complete` which was a complex onboarding flow that wasn't appropriate for new users.

### 🔧 Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Fixed Signup Redirect Logic**
- **File**: `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated redirect logic to send users to appropriate home page based on role
- **Before**: `router.push('/onboarding/complete')`
- **After**: Role-based redirect to `/main` or `/admin/control-panel`

#### 2. **Enhanced Authentication Configuration**
- **File**: `src/lib/auth-config.ts`
- **Change**: Added proper redirect callback for NextAuth
- **Added**: `redirect` callback to handle post-authentication redirects

#### 3. **Fixed NextAuth Route Configuration**
- **File**: `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- **Change**: Updated to use correct auth configuration
- **Before**: `import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth'`
- **After**: `import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth-config'`

#### 4. **Simplified Home Page Redirect**
- **File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed reference to non-existent `/simple-onboarding` route
- **Now**: Redirects new users directly to `/main` page

### 🧪 Testing Results

#### Authentication Flow Test
```bash
node scripts/test-auth-flow.js
```

**Results:**
- ✅ **Users**: 3 test users created
- ✅ **Profiles**: 0 (will be created during signup)
- ✅ **Settings**: 3 user settings configured
- ✅ **Password verification**: Working correctly
- ✅ **Role distribution**: admin(1), premium(1), user(1)

#### Test User Accounts
1. **Free User**: `free@example.com` / `password123`
2. **Premium User**: `premium@example.com` / `password123`
3. **Admin User**: `admin@example.com` / `password123`

### 🔄 User Flow After Fix

#### New User Registration:
1. User fills out signup form
2. Account is created in database
3. User is automatically signed in
4. **Redirect**: User goes to `/main` (home page)
5. User sees personalized dashboard

#### Existing User Login:
1. User enters credentials
2. Authentication succeeds
3. **Redirect**: 
   - Admin users → `/admin/control-panel`
   - Regular users → `/main`
